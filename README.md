This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the supply chain data for a fashion and makeup product company. The dataset encompasses various aspects of the supply chain process, including product details, sales, revenue, customer demographics, stock levels, lead times, shipping details, and supplier information. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights to optimize supply chain performance and inform strategic business decisions.

## Objective
The primary focus of this project is to address key challenges related to supply chain management, including shipment efficiency, inventory optimization, and revenue analysis. The objectives include:

- **Analyzing Supply Chain Data:** Identifying trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities within the supply chain.
- **Visualizing Insights:** Creating dynamic dashboards in Power BI to present findings to stakeholders effectively.
- **Proposing Improvements:** Offering strategic recommendations based on data insights to enhance supply chain performance.

## Project Workflow
This project follows a three-stage workflow:

1. **Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL):**
   - Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query to ensure consistency and usability.

2. **Data Modeling:**
   - The processed data was loaded into Power BI Desktop, where relationships between tables were established to enable effective analysis.

3. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Interactive dashboards were designed to provide stakeholders with actionable insights.
